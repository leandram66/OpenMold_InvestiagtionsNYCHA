<p>The Bronx Documentary Center hosted an open reception for the “Speak Out: NYCHA Tenants Fighting To Breathe Better At Home” exhibition, addressing mold & leaks inflated by NYCHA’s long list of backlog orders.
</p>

<p>The exhibit features tenants coping with leaky ceilings with trash using trash bags and kids wearing respiratory masks to mitigate asthma attacks caused by the mold.   
</p>

<p>Former Manhattan Together and South Bronx Churches leader, Michael Stanley, marked the event as both a commemoration and celebration, reflecting on the 10-year anniversary of the Baez vs NYCHA case which sought relief for NYCHA residents affected by mold. 
</p>

<p>“This event is a commemoration of, to some extent…10 years since we reached the Baez vs. NYCHA consent decree on mold and leaks,” says Stanley. 
</p>

<p> “To another extent, it's more like a celebration of twenty, or by some counts, thirty years of organizing in public housing, and particularly around mold and leaks,” continues Stanley. 
</p>

<p>Despite the 2019 Ombudsperson Call Center’s introduction, improvements in mold-related issues only began this year. 
</p>

<p> Below are open cases in relation to mold investigations and their decrease over time.</p>

<p> “I think the important thing about this exhibit to know is that while even on mold and leaks, there are still far too many tenants who suffer needlessly, a system has been built up where some tenants are actually getting the repairs they need. Maybe 10 or 15 percent only, but that's a thousand times better than it was 10 or 15 years ago, and it's an example of if organized people stick with it long enough, it can, a real difference can be made,” expresses Stanley.
